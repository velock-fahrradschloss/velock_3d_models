# Velock 3D Models  

In this repository, you will find all the 3D models needed to create the Velock POC. Please note that a compatible padlock is required to use these models. Feel free to customize the models to fit any padlock of your choice.  

### Assembly Instructions  
The **BikeLockTop** components must be mounted either with screws and drilled holes or glued together. If you choose to glue them, wireless charging components will be necessary.

To assemble the backlight components, you can use a drill, as the component models do not contain any mounting holes. This approach makes the models more modular, allowing you to use different PCB solutions and bike mounts. If you donâ€™t want to create your own, this repo already includes a bike mount. The top plate can be clamped or screwed together.

Feel free to modify any 3D model to your liking. These models are intended purely to provide a functional casing. They are not designed to be aesthetically pleasing or size-efficient.
